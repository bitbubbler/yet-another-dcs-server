# YADS - Yet Another DCS Server
![logo-placeholder](/images/logo.png)

# Abstract
Best quotes to describe the overall goal of this project: 

- @bitbubbler "Build some cool shit, make it public. Have fun"
- @skeletonwburg "Broad plan is to build an Open Source software, based on DCS-gRPC, that adds functions to a running mission to build a dynamic frontline ground war."

In other words:
- focus on dynamically changing the state of a mission (adding, removing units)
- D&D esque Gamemaster toolkit, based on F10 map markers
- PvE focused 
- event driven AI behavior based on mission types (e.g CAS, Strike, CAP, etc.)
- persistence of mission state to enable 24x7 server operations
